Release Notes for cairo-sip v0.1:
=============================
Cairo-sip provides a sip libarary that is useful for building enterprise grade, 
MRCPv2 compliant speech server solutions.  This libary can be useful for the client
and server side processing.

This is the first release for the cairo-sip project.  This release provides
a libarary of basic sip and sdp capabilities for MRCPv2 applications (both
server and client side).  SIP is an important part MRCPv2 system.  The following
is a direct quote from the MRCPv2 specification

   "MRCPv2 is not a "stand-alone" protocol - it relies on a session management protocol
   such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to establish the MRCPv2
   control session between the client and the server, and for rendezvous
   and capability discovery. It also depends on SIP and SDP to
   establish the media sessions and associated parameters between the
   media source or sink and the media server."
