Welcome to Project Cairo

  Cairo provides an open source speech resource server written entirely in the Java programming language.  To achieve maximum compatibility with existing and future speech clients the Cairo server has been designed from the ground up to comply with the {{{faq.html#WhatIsMRCPv2}MRCPv2}} standard.

  The purpose of Cairo is not to duplicate functionality provided by existing open source speech projects such as {{{http://freetts.sourceforge.net}FreeTTS}} and {{{http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/sphinx4/}Sphinx}}, but rather to build upon them and provide additional functionality such as clustering, load balancing and failover support in order to meet the requirements necessary for use in enterprise scale deployments of speech/telephony applications.
