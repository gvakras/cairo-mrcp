Release Notes for Cairo v0.3:
=============================

Project Cairo sets out to provide an enterprise grade, Media Resource
Control Protocol Version 2 (MRCPv2) compliant speech server solution
utilizing existing open source speech resources.

Version History
---------------

Cairo v0.3 adds the improved support for speech clients by adding support for 
hotwword mode, pre-recorded prompts, SIP session shutdown (via BYE commands), 
DTMF (via INFO) and basic register method for softphone integration.  There has also
been further improvements with recognition performance.  This release also introduces 
3 new subprojects: cairo-rtp, cairo-sip and cairo-client.

Cairo v0.2 adds support for establishing sessions using Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) signalling and improves speech recognition performance by
matching the voice models used by Sphinx to the sampling rate of the
received audio data.

Cairo v0.1 implemented support for speech synthesis and speech recognition
functionality using Media Resource Control Protocol Version 2 (MRCPv2) for
the control channel between the speech client and the speech resource and
Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) for streaming audio to and from the
media sink/source.


Change Log for Project Cairo:
=============================

Cairo v0.3:

* Adds seperate cairo-sip and cairo-rtp jars that can be shared between 
servers and clients.  Adds the cairo-client jar for ease the development
of mrcpv2 clients.

* Adds the ability to handles BYE requests and releases speech resources at 
the end of sessions.

* Adds support fo detecting out of grammar respnses.

* Adds support for hotword barge-in mode.

* Adds shell scripts for running on Unix

* Adds basic support for the SIP Info method (to support SIP based DTMF).

* Adds support for the SIP Register method (to support demos using SIP softphones like Xlite)

* Improves recognition detection by cofiguring garbace collection and improved endpoint detection
and configuring the endpointer.

* Improves rtp transmit with JMF workaround to ensure 20ms packet size. 

* Adds support for pre-recorded prompts

* Adds a simple natural language processing to obtain a semantic interpretion of the utterance based
on the grammar.

Cairo v0.2:
-----------
* Use SIP instead of Java RMI for session initiation.

* Use the WSJ 8khz acoustic model instead of the 16khz model for speech
recognition processing.  The 8khz model matches the sampling rate of the
codec used for RTP audio data and as a result recognition performance is
much improved.


Cairo v0.1:
-----------
No prior release to compare with.
