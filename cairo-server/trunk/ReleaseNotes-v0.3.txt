Release Notes for Cairo v0.3:
=============================

Project Cairo sets out to provide an enterprise grade, Media Resource
Control Protocol Version 2 (MRCPv2) compliant speech server solution
utilizing existing open source speech resources.

Version History
---------------

Cairo v0.3 adds improved support for speech clients by adding support for 
hotword recognition mode, pre-recorded prompt playback, active session termination (via SIP BYE commands), 
SIP based DTMF detection using the SIP INFO method and basic register method for softphone integration.  There has also
been further improvements made in speech recognition performance and endpointing.  This release also factors out some common code into  
3 new subprojects: cairo-rtp, cairo-sip and cairo-client.

Cairo v0.2 adds support for establishing sessions using Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) signalling and improves speech recognition performance by
matching the voice models used by Sphinx to the sampling rate of the
received audio data.

Cairo v0.1 implemented support for speech synthesis and speech recognition
functionality using Media Resource Control Protocol Version 2 (MRCPv2) for
the control channel between the speech client and the speech resource and
Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) for streaming audio to and from the
media sink/source.


Change Log for Project Cairo:
=============================

Cairo v0.3:
-----------

	* Re-usable SIP and RTP related functionaliy has been factored out into separate cairo-sip and cairo-rtp sub-projects that can be re-used by both speech servers and clients.
	
	* Adds the ability to handle SIP BYE requests which are used to trigger the release of speech resources at the end of an active session.
	
	* Adds support for detection of out-of-grammar responses.
	
	* Adds support for hotword barge-in mode.
	
	* Adds shell scripts for launching speech server processes on Unix/Linux.
	
	* Adds support for SIP based DTMF detection using the SIP INFO method.
	
	* Adds support for direct connection from SIP softphones like Xlite by implementing the SIP REGISTER method.
	
	* Improved recognition performance has been achieved by a number of methods, including adjusting the garbage collection strategy and better start and end of speech detection (endpointing).
	
	* Improves RTP transmit with JMF workaround to ensure 20ms packet size. 
	
	* Adds support for playback of pre-recorded prompts on the speechsynth channel.
	
	* Adds natural language processing to obtain a semantic interpretion of the utterance based on the grammar.

Cairo v0.2:
-----------

* Use SIP instead of Java RMI for session initiation.

* Use the WSJ 8khz acoustic model instead of the 16khz model for speech
recognition processing.  The 8khz model matches the sampling rate of the
codec used for RTP audio data and as a result recognition performance is
much improved.


Cairo v0.1:
-----------

No prior release to compare with.
